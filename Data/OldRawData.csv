See Supplemental Figure S1 for a visualization of these criteria. “COVID-19 index date” is defined as the earliest date of a positive indicator for a patient. For patients with multiple positive tests or diagnosis codes, we select the date of the first positive test as the index.

The original model was trained on patients who were seen at a Long COVID specialty clinic, as there was no official ICD-10-CM code for PASC or Long COVID until October 1, 2021. At present, however, the ICD-10-CM code U09.9 (“Post COVID-19 condition, unspecified”) has been available for use for just over a year. Due to its greater specificity and larger sample size, the current model uses N3C patients that qualify for all of the above inclusion criteria and have a U09.9 diagnosis code as training and test data (n = 7221 for training and n = 1653 for test).

For patients who had a Long COVID symptom (eg, dyspnea) in the 30–180 days prior to the index date, they could still be diagnosed with Long COVID based on postindex incidence of a new symptom category (eg, brain fog).4 5 As an example, a patient would need to have any respiratory symptom on three dates in the 30–180 days following COVID-19 and could not have had any respiratory symptom in the 30–180 days prior to index date (online supplemental figure 1a).

Symptoms were based on key terms identified from EHR notes in the N3C NLP dataset.6 From the list of available symptoms, compiled from 1849 NLP key terms, we divided relevant Long COVID-associated symptoms into seven categories, ‘brain fog’, ‘respiratory symptoms’, ‘loss of taste/smell’, ‘musculoskeletal symptoms’, ‘fatigue’, ‘cough’, and ‘cardiovascular symptoms’, based on prior symptoms-based definitions of Long COVID4–6 28 29 (online supplemental figure 1b).
