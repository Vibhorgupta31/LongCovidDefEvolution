At present,however, the ICD-10-CM code U09.9 (“Post COVID-19 condition,unspecified”) has been available for use for just over a year.

The clinical definition required the presence of an ICD-10 diagnoses code for post-COVID-19 condition (U09.9). If a patient had multiple diagnoses codes for the outcome, we used the earliest occurrence.Details of the algorithm employed for identifying the probability of PASC have been described elsewhere.29 Briefly, the ML model estimates the predicted probability of PASC for patients who had at least one healthcare visit and at least one diagnosis, or medication following COVID-19 diagnosis using their demographic, health care utilization, diagnoses, and medication information. The model calculates the probability of PASC for each patient starting 100 days after COVID-19 diagnosis based on changes in diagnoses and medications observed as of that day compared with the 100 days prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. New probabilities are estimated at 30-day intervals until 300 days after COVID-19 diagnosis (with correspondingly increasing pre-COVID-19 intervals) or June 1, 2022, whichever comes first.

For patients who had a Long COVID symptom (eg, dyspnea) in the 30–180 days prior to the index date, they could still be diagnosed with Long COVID based on postindex incidence of a new symptom category (eg, brain fog).4 5 As an example, a patient would need to have any respiratory symptom on three dates in the 30–180 days following COVID-19 and could not have had any respiratory symptom in the 30–180 days prior to index date (online supplemental figure 1a).

Symptoms were based on key terms identified from EHR notes in the N3C NLP dataset.6 From the list of available symptoms, compiled from 1849 NLP key terms, we divided relevant Long COVID-associated symptoms into seven categories, ‘brain fog’, ‘respiratory symptoms’, ‘loss of taste/smell’, ‘musculoskeletal symptoms’, ‘fatigue’, ‘cough’, and ‘cardiovascular symptoms’, based on prior symptoms-based definitions of Long COVID4–6 28 29 (online supplemental figure 1b).
