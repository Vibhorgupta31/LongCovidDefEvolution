35589549,Identifying who has long COVID in the USA: a machine learning approach using N3C data,SM,Pfaff ER,Lancet Digit Health,2022,,TRUE,FALSE,,"We defined our base population (n=1 793 604) as any non-deceased adult patient (age ≥18 years) with either an International Classification of Diseases-10-Clinical Modification COVID-19 diagnosis code (U07.1) from an inpatient or emergency health-care visit, or a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or antigen test, and for whom at least 90 days have passed since COVID-19 index date. ","Because the definition, clinical guidelines, and documentation practices for long COVID are still evolving, there is no gold standard to validate computable phenotypes and to train machine learning models. However, three N3C sites provided lists of locally identified patients who had visited that site’s long COVID specialty clinic at least once. These patients represent a silver standard within our base population (n=597, once our base population criteria were applied). Hereafter, we will refer to this group of patients as long COVID clinic patients; patients identified by our trained model as patients with long COVID will be referred to as patients with potential long COVID. This silver standard enabled us to develop a model to identify patients warranting care at a long COVID clinic—a valuable proxy for long COVID until a true gold standard is available."
35665012,Generalizable Long COVID Subtypes: Findings from the NIH N3C and RECOVER Programs,SM,Reese JT,medRxiv,2022,,FALSE,TRUE,,"Phenotypic Clustering of Patients with long COVID We hypothesized that consistent subgroups of patients with long COVID can be defined based on the spectrum of phenotypic features in the patients’ electronic health records (EHR). Our previous analysis identified 287 clinical findings previously reported in studies on long COVID and coded these findings using terms of the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) (19, 21). Numerous algorithms have been developed that define a fuzzy, specificity-weighted similarity metric between a patient and a computational disease model or between pairs of patients (22–25). Here, we adapted an algorithm called Phenomizer that calculates semantic similarity between a pair of patients based on phenotypes (Methods) (26).  Common clustering methods define feature vectors with one field for each measured quantity. In principle, one could define a feature vector with 287 dimensions, one for each of the clinical findings related to long COVID, and for each clinical finding identified in a patient, a “1” would be placed in the corresponding field of the vector, otherwise a “0”. Patient similarity could then be measured by calculating the cosine between any two such vectors, which essentially counts the number of exact matches normalized by the total number of features in each vector.",
